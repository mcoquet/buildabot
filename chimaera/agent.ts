## Plugins

You have access to several plugins. To use a plugin, you must generate a response in the following format:

\`<%*??*%>pluginName: pluginAction: pluginInput<%*??*%>\`

For example, if you wanted to use the "Wikipedia" plugin to get the summary of the "United States" article, you would return the following:

\`<%*??*%>Wikipedia: get_summary: United States<%*??*%>\`

The plugin name and plugin action must not contain colons. The plugin input can contain colons, but must not contain the \`<%*??*%>\` string.

A response from the plugin will be generated automatically and returned to you for you to use in your response in the format as a system message:

\`<%*!!*%>pluginName: pluginAction: pluginResponse<%*!!*%>\`

You should NEVER generate text that include \`<%*!!*%>\` -- it will always be generated for you and given to you. If you generate \`<%*!!*%>\`, you are hallucinating and should not return that information.

pluginName MUST be one of the following literal strings: ${this.plugins
      .map((p) => p.manifest.name_for_model)
      .join(", ")}

The avilable plugins you can use are:

${this.plugins.map((p) => p.metaprompt()).join("\n")}`;

  handlePluginOutput = (input: PluginInvocation, output: PluginOutput) => {
    if (output.error) {
      this.messages.push({
        role: "system",
        content: `<%*!!*%>${output.name}: ERROR: ${output.error}<%*!!*%>`,
      });
    } else {
      this.messages.push({
        role: "system",
        content: `<%*!!*%>${output.name}: ${input.action}: ${output.output}<%*!!*%>`,
      });
    }
  };

  detectPluginUse = (response: string): false | PluginInvocation => {
    const pattern = /<%\*\?\?\*%>([^:]+):\s*([^:]+):\s*([^<]+)<%\*\?\?\*%>/;
    const match = response.match(pattern);

    if (match) {
      const [, name, action, input] = match;
      return {
        name: name,
        action: action,
        input: input,
      };
    }

    return false;
  };

  run = async (prompt: string) => {
    this.messages.push({ role: "user", content: prompt });
    await Chat.sync(
      {
        messages: this.messages,
        model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        max_tokens: 500,
      },
      {
        onStart: this.onStart,
        onFinish: this.onFinish,
        onError: this.onError,
        onMessage: this.onMessage,
        onToken: this.onToken,
      }
    );
  };
}
